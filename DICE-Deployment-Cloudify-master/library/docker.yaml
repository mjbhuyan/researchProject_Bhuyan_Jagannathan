# Types and relationships that make it possible to create Docker hosts and run
# containers on them.


data_types:

  dice.datatypes.docker.RegistryAuth:
    description: Authentication data for docker registry
    properties:
      username: { required: false }
      password: { required: false }


node_types:

  dice.components.docker.Server:
    description: Docker instance that can host containers.
    derived_from: dice.chef.SoftwareComponent
    properties:
      create_runlist:
        default:
          - recipe[apt::default]
          - recipe[dice_common::default]
          - recipe[docker::default]
      configure_runlist:
        default:
          - recipe[docker::configure]
      start_runlist:
        default:
          - recipe[docker::start]
    attributes:
      address:
        description: >
          Address that can be passed to clients when connecting to docker
          server. Typically, this will be set to something like
          tcp://1.2.3.4:2375.

  dice.components.docker.Container:
    description: Docker container that should be run.
    derived_from: cloudify.nodes.Root
    properties:
      command:
        description: >
          Command that should be run in container. Note that command is a
          template that is expanded just before the container is started. All
          occurences of ``{attr_name}`` in this template will be replaced by
          the value of ``attr_name`` attribute.
        required: false
        default: null
      image:
        description: Name of the image that should be run.
        required: true
      tag:
        description: Image tag that should be run.
        required: true
      registry_auth:
        description: >
          Username and password for private registry. If image is from public
          registry, this property can be omitted.
        type: dice.datatypes.docker.RegistryAuth
        required: false
      port_mapping:
        description: >
          Map of container ports to host ports. If host port is set to
          ``null``, random port will be used for binding. Actual runtime
          mapping can be retrieved from ``port_mapping`` attribute. Typical
          examples of mapping would be ``80/tcp: 9876``, which will bind port
          80 from the container to host port 9876, and ``80/tcp: null``, which
          will bind container port 80 to random ephemeral port on host.
        required: false
        default: {}
      host:
        description: >
          Address of the docker host. If container is already connected to
          docker node, this property can be left out.
        required: false
        default: null
    attributes:
      id:
        description: Id of the container that has been created.
      name:
        description: Name of the container that has been created.
      port_mapping:
        description: >
          Instantiated port mapping. Any ports that were allowed to be mapped
          to random port in port_mapping property are in this mapping fixed to
          specific port.
    interfaces:
      cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:

  # Firewall rules for docker
  dice.firewall_rules.docker.Server:
    derived_from: dice.firewall_rules.Base
    description: >
      Firewall rules for basic docker setup. Note that this only opens ports
      for docker client-server communication, all other ports that containers
      might use need to be opened separately.
    properties:
      rules:
        default:

relationships:

  dice.relationships.docker.HostedOn:
    derived_from: cloudify.relationships.connected_to
    description: >
      Informs deployment services what docker instance will host current
      container. If this relationship is not set, container needs to have its
      host property set.
